left off as i discovered css variables and logic. going to attempt to allow for different amounts of rows and columns by using css grid and having the amount of columns/rows dynamically change based on the user's input. this will mean using the function i have now which creates an X amount of divs based on the number inputted into the function, i will add to that function by:
1) accessing css through javascript
2) saving the number of rows/columns to be made to a variable that can be used in the css file
3) prompting the user to input or select between the amount of rows and columns. 
    if im going to have them select, it would probably have to be an event listener that saves a number to a variable through a button press and then to the css file
    easier would be having them input a number, but that doesnt look very special

with all of these fundamental projects, im looking to improve my understanding and work through problem solving. i may eventually revisit some projects and attempt to design them better, but at the moment im focusing only on the functionality and secondly, ease of use.

I have a lot to learn. Also, seeing that CSS and styling choices are difficult to make without an idea first. All of this is much more difficult without mapping out what needs to be done and in what order.
